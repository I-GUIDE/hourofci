    "Although the technology has been successfull in reducing the size of the CPUs over time, the clock frequency (processing speed) of the CPUs do not seem optimal to get any faster. It's becase increasing the clock speed of the CPUs will increase the power consumption and consequently the need for much stronger cooling systems. This means more cost, less environmental friendly, and therefore, less favorable! \n",

    "\n",
    "Sport car: \n",
    "- Latency: 3 time unit\n",
    "- Throughput: 2/3 = 0.66 box/time unit\n",

    "Truck:\n",
    "- Latency: 6 time unit\n",
    "- Throughput: 6/6 = 1 box/time unit\n",

    "We can see that the first senario has much smaller latency (good!) and also smaller throughput (bad!) and the second senario gives a much larger latency (bad!) but larger throughput (good!). <br/> \n",
    "As obvious from the Cargill example, the second senario wins. But what if we use 3 sport cars at the same time?\n",
