For example, we know there are different ways to calculate the distance between our home and our work. The distance can be based on measurement units (e.g., miles or kilometers), or we might simply define the distance based on the travel time.</li>\n",
    "<li>Knowing about representation is linked with understanding the effect of space. If you take a look at two world maps below; one designed using Mercator map projection and one designed using equal-area map projection, you will immediately notice how the size of Africa differs. Map design has a lot of power in terms of representations such as visual hierarchy, figure-ground, proximity, and closure. These are all related to how we perceive the representation within space. The relations between dynamic entities are also evaluated in spatial representations.</li></ul>\n",

Spatial reasoning often uses several representations and several comparisons. Imagine that you are driving from work to home and listening to your favorite radio station. You just heard that there is a traffic accident on your route which will probably result in a delay for your arrival. You make a spatial decision by selecting another alternative which enables you to detour and avoid the accident caused traffic jam.</li></ul>\n",
