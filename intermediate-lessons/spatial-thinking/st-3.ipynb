    "Additionally, some environmental and economic factors also play an important role in the decision making process. For example, the optimal areas to locate a landfill facility are clay and gypsum deposits as leakage into underground water and surrounding land is minimized. Also, the texture and the existence of an argillaceous horizon are indicators of soil permeability, which must be avoided. Surface water provides a source of water for infiltration and subsequent percolation. Areas farther from streams are more suitable to locate the facility than areas bordering the stream buffer. Land suitability decreases as slope increases. At a 15% slope, the suitability is null, since the area would require unreasonable expenditure for adequate landfill design, construction, and operation. And last, estimated expropriation costs are considered in the analysis depending on land use and vegetation coverage.  \n",
